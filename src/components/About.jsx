            This is my github account with custom jacket on. I show all my repositories through a Yu-Gi-Oh card. To retrieve the information I use the <span>github API </span>
            I created this page with the builder tool <span>Vite</span> I wanted to learn how to work with it. Also with the coding language <span>React</span>.

            This is where I want to explore even further and expand my knowledge of it. The languages I used for this project are <span>React</span>, <span>HTML</span>, <span>SCSS</span>, <span>CSS</span>, <span>Javascript</span>.
            For this project, I was given a week to create it.
